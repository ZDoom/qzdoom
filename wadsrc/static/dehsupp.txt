// DeHackEd made the erroneous assumption that if a state didn't appear in
// Doom with an action function, then it was incorrect to assign it one.
// This is a list of the states that had action functions, so we can figure
// out where in the original list of states a DeHackEd codepointer is.
// (DeHackEd might also have done this for compatibility between Doom
// versions, because states could move around, but actions would never
// disappear, but that doesn't explain why frame patches specify an exact
// state rather than a code pointer.)
